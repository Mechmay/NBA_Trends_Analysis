<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">This data was originally sourced from 538’s Analysis of the <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/the-complete-history-of-every-nba-team-by-elo" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gamut-15hd59n-Anchor e14vpv2g0">Complete History Of The NBA</a> and contains the original, unmodified data from <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gamut-15hd59n-Anchor e14vpv2g0">Basketball Reference</a> as well as several additional variables 538 added to perform their own analysis. </p>

For this project I’ve limited the data to just 5 teams and 10 columns (plus one constructed column, <code class="code__2rdF32qjRVp7mMVBHuPwDS">point_diff</code>, the difference between <code class="code__2rdF32qjRVp7mMVBHuPwDS">pts</code> and <code class="code__2rdF32qjRVp7mMVBHuPwDS">opp_pts</code>).</p>
